The system allows users to store and organize data of clients who borrow money, while automatically computing interest based on user-defined settings.

✅ Create loan records with:

Loan amount

Interest rate (customizable based on client/user preference)

Payment terms

✅ Automatic computation of:

Interest amount

Total payable amount

Amortization / periodic payment

✅ Update and edit existing loan data

⚙️ System Logic

Interest rate is dynamic and depends on the value set by the user or client.

The system automatically calculates the total payment based on:
